# Convert Images From JPG/PNG into DICOM

In this repo you will find the code to do the conversion from a normal image into dicom image using `Python`, for more information about how it works you can see my blog post [here](https://pycad.co/convert-jpg-or-png-images-into-dicom/).

## Requirements

```
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
pip install pydicom
```

And you are gonna need a `pre-existing` dicom file, because the idea here is to convert your normal image into an array then fill an existing dicom file with the new array that you created from the image (everything is explained in the [blog](https://pycad.co/convert-jpg-or-png-images-into-dicom/) post.

## Conversion tools

If you are not familiar with `Python` then you may think of using my [new GUI](https://pycad.co/convert-jpg-or-png-images-into-dicom/) that does the same thing with few clicks! Please try out and give me your feedback
